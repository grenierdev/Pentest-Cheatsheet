# Nikto

Site: https://cirt.net/Nikto2

> Nikto is a highly configurable Open Source web server scanner that tests for thousands of dangerous files and programs, vulnerable server versions and various server configuration issues. It performs well, but is not designed for stealth as it will send many requests and embed information about itself in the User-Agent header.

## Examples
```sh
