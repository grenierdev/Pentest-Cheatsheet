# Install latest Virtualbox

Virtualbox 6.1.34 has issues with kernel 5.18. Update to 6.1.36!

> Hopefully 6.1.36  will be mainstream when you'll read this.

```sh
apt remove virtualbox
lsmod | grep vbox # Make sure there's no module left (nuke with rmmod)
echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian bullseye main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
# Download latest deb from virtualbox.org
```

# Setup without TPM

During the setup, you'll need to access the registry editor and add 3 keys.

You'll need to launch the console before clicking on the "Install Now" with SHIFT+F10.

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig\BypassTPMCheck (DWORD 32) = 1
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig\BypassRAMCheck (DWORD 32) = 1
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig\BypassSecureBootCheck (DWORD 32) = 1
```
