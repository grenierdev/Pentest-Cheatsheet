You'll cycle back here to move laterally in the subnet.

## Subnet, Hosts, vHosts

[Host scan](./Techniques/NetworkScan.md#host-discovery) for targets; crawl website to find domains and subdomains; brute force subdomain lookup and [vhost](./Techniques/NetworkScan.md#vhost-discovery); inspect [SSL certificate](./Techniques/OpenSSL.md#ssl-debug) for subdomain; retrieve [WHOIS information](./Techniques/NetworkScan.md#whois-information) for a domain.

> **Don't forget** that subdomain also have subdomains!

> **Take notes** of patterns in names or IPs.

## Ports and Services

[Port scan](./Techniques/NetworkScan.md#port-discovery) first; [service scan](./Techniques/NetworkScan.md#service-discovery) found ports; [banner grab](./Techniques/NetworkScan.md#banner-grab-manually) the port without fingerprint match.

> **Don't forget** only connect-scan work over tunnels!

> **Take notes** of patterns and versions of ports and services. Sysadmin tend to reuse same software and configuration.

## Domain

Encountered LDAP or Active Directory, launch [enum4linux](./Tools/enum4linux.md) you might find users and objects.

> **Take notes** of domains, users, groups, policies.

## Infosec

Navigate website for employees, authors, contact data, interesting notes; [CeWL](./Tools/CeWL.md) to generate word list specific to a website.

## Connectivity and Firewall

Capture [Ping](./Techniques/NetworkSniffing.md#ping-icmp), [HTTP request](./Techniques/NetworkSniffing.md#http), [SMB connect](./Techniques/NetworkSniffing.md#smb), [FTP connect](./Techniques/NetworkSniffing.md#ftp), or any other port with Bash, NC or Powershell.

Show firewall [status and it's rules](./Techniques/Firewall.md#status); [create new rule](./Techniques/Firewall.md#add-exception) for your reverse/bind shell.

> **Don't forget** sysadmin are lasy-ass and usually configures firewall port both-direction for running services. Meaning that if port 3306 is open inbound, it probably open for outbound connection too.

> **Take notes** of connectivity and firewall rules.

## whoami

[Where are you](./Techniques/Footing.md#where-am-i)?, [Who are you](./Techniques/Footing.md#who-am-i)? [What are your permissions](./Techniques/Footing.md#what-are-my-powerpermission)? What can you access? What can you manipulate?

...whoami, id, passwd, sudoers, groups, sudo -l, SUID, GUID

> **Take notes** of your privilege and retrieve your password if you can.

## Users, Groups

Who's there with you, what are the level of security
